# ResPy

## Overview
`respy` is a Python-based reservoir simulation package designed for working with regular and semi-regular Cartesian grids. The package includes:
- A schedule module for managing the well history.
- A module for reservoir fluid property calculations.
- Numerical solvers for reservoir simulation.
- Pre- and post-processing tools, including visualization capabilities.
- Analytical solutions for linear and radial flow.

## Features
- **Scheduling Module**: Organizes simulation runs efficiently.
- **Fluid Property Calculation**: Includes models for evaluating reservoir fluid behavior.
- **Reservoir Simulation**: Supports regular and semi-regular Cartesian grids for numerical modeling.
- **Visualization Tools**: Provides pre- and post-processing visualization features.
- **Analytical Solutions**: Implements well-known solutions for linear and radial flow cases.

## Installation
```bash
pip install respy
```
